The seed data is from the TIP 13Q3 modification period and contains all projects within the City of Atlanta jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n## Viewing the Data\r\n\r\nThe data formats used here (csv, geoJSON) are [both natively](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-csv-and-tsv-data) [supported by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/mapping-geojson-files-on-github), that is you can view them as tables or maps just by clicking on the file name.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nmap: https://github.com/landonreed/plan-git/blob/master/plan2040/AT-267.geoJSON\r\n\r\ntable: https://github.com/landonreed/plan-git/blob/master/plan2040/projects.csv\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nIf there is something wrong with the data you see here, feel free to edit (either locally on your own computer or directly on GitHub).  By [using a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) or the [issue tracking system](https://github.com/features/projects/issues), you'll let us know that something needs to change here and we'll address it as soon as we can.\r\n\r\nFor an easy way to edit geoJSON in the browser, check out http://geojson.io/\r\n\r\nA super easy way to work with csv on Windows is with [notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and the [TextFX plugin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12699833/textfx-menu-is-missing-in-notepad).  You can [line up multiple lines by commas](http://superuser.com/questions/120488/converting-csv-to-fixed-width-in-notepad), making for a very readable csv!\r\n\r\nThere also seem to be [some great plugins](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331211/sublime-text-2-alignment-of-comma-separated-values) available for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
